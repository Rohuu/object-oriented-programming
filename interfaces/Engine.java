package interfaces;
// interface: interfaces contains abstract functions(functions without body)
// its like abstract class only ... functions are public and abstract..... and variables are static and final by default in interfaces.
// interfaces mostly specifies like what the class is doing not how it is doing it.
// how it is doing is specifies by the child classes which implements the interface
// abstract class can have some information but interface can't
// abstract classes can have any type of methods default,static,abstract methods
// in interface variables are final
// coz we have no constructor in interface
// if no constructor then how will we initialise values, that's why they are final
// but
// in interface, inside methods variables can be final or non-final.
// abstract classes can be extended by using extends keyword
// interfaces can be implemented by using implements keyword
// abstract classes can't be multiple inherited, but we can implement more than one interfaces
